    <!-- To add breaks to HTML use the <br> tag -->     
    <p>
        There are tags that require closing tags, such as - 
        <ul>
            <li>h1</li>
            <li>p</li>
            <li>span</li>
            <li>div</li>
            <li>ul</li>
            <li>li</li>
        </ul>

        Some of the tags don't require a closing tag, such as - 
        <ul>
            <li>br</li>
            <li>hr</li>
            <li>img</li>
        </ul> 

        Ordered lists can be created using the 'ol' tag. Giving a 'type' will indicate the numbering type - 'A', 'a', '1', 'I', 'i'
        
        <ol type = "A">
            <li>Piya</li>
            <li>Aarohee</li>
            <li>Sid</li>
        </ol>
